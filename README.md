# artisan-chatbot

## **Description**

This project implements a chatbot feature, "Ava," designed to simulate a conversation between users and a virtual assistant. The chatbot supports sending, editing, and deleting messages.

It uses PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for data persistence, FastAPI for the backend API, and React with TypeScript for the frontend. We will have a server side (backend)
and a client side (frontend). This setup enhances security by mitigating the risk of
exposing sensitive information, such as the database secret key and gemini key, on the client side.
